# Developing Chatbots

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building and experimenting with chatbots.

## File Overview

- **Develop_chatbots.ipynb**  
  This notebook includes:
  - Data preprocessing for chatbot development.
  - Implementation of machine learning models.
  - Training and testing phases for the chatbot.
  - Code and explanations to guide users through the development process.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Develop and train a functional chatbot.
- Demonstrate the use of machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).
- Provide a hands-on approach to understanding chatbot pipelines.

## How to Use
 **Clone the Repository**:
git clone https://github.com/gayatrikothapalli/Developing-Chatbots.git
Open the Notebook:
Use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any compatible platform to run Develop_chatbots.ipynb.

**Requirements**:
